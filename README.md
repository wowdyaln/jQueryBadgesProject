# jQuery Badges

Welcome to the jQuery Badges Project! For this project, you'll be creating a web app that displays all of the courses you've taken on Code School by displaying its titles and badges. We will test your knowledge of JavaScript and jQuery to make AJAX requests, and create DOM objects programmatically.

Please follow the instructions below to complete the project. Be sure to run tests to make sure your tests are passing before submitting your code.
